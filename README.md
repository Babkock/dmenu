[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Babkock/dmenu.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Babkock/dmenu)

Suckless dynamic menu. Since this is a tool I pretty much rely on now, I made a new repository for it. All patches were applied by hand.

Features:

* Additional color scheme in config.h
* [Alpha](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/alpha/)
* [Mouse support](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/mouse-support/)
* [Scroll](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/scroll/) on long lines
* [Command history](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/scripts/dmenu_run_with_command_history/)
* [Window border](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/border/)
