# dmenu

Suckless dynamic menu. Since this is a tool I pretty much rely on now, I made a new repository for it.

Features:

* [Text scroll](http://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/mouse-support/) on long lines
* [Command history](http://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/scripts/dmenu_run_with_command_history/)
* [Window border](http://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/border/)
